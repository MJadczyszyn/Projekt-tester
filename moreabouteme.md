# My task in current job:



# Plans for the futre:



# In my free time:

- Cycling - My main sport activity recently.
- Football -  Due to a knee injury I was forced to stop playing football. In my spare time, I mainly watch Serie A competitions.
- Games - I prefer games where I can compete with other players. I play city builders and RPGs from time to time.
- Boardgames & puzzles - This is a new hobby for me. It is a great way to spend time with friends.
- Movies - I've probably watched too many movies (around 1,600) and still have a lot to watch.
- Music - I used to listen a lot of rock music. I even try my hands on drums.
- Fragrances - I spend too much money on this hobby.
